passmenu-otp
============

A simple extension of [passmenu][passmenu] friendly to one-time passwords (OTP),
often used in two-factor authentication (2FA).


## What is this?

[pass][pass] is a minimalistic password manager, which became known thanks to
its incredible versatility and abundance of extension points.

One tool which makes _pass_ extremely convenient for everyday use is
[passmenu][passmenu] -- a shell script, which utilizes _dmenu_ to offer user
interactive list of available passwords. Having selected a specific password,
user can copy it to clipboard temporarily, or use _xdotool_ to input it into
focused text area.

Among others, _pass_ can also be used to manage one-time passwords (OTP),
commonly used for two-factor authentication (2FA). This is done using
[pass-otp][pass-otp]. Sadly, since the command-line invocation differs for OTP's
and conventional passwords, _passmenu_ cannot be used with OTP's out of the box,
forcing users to clumsily open a new shell everytime they need to generate a OTP.
This not only creates time strain on the user's productivity, but also raises
overall stress levels since OTP use is often limited to couple of seconds only.

This project attempts to very simply resolve this problem by bringing support
for OTP's to your friendly neighborhood _passmenu_.


## How to use it?

_passmenu-otp_ works the same way as _passmenu_:

  1. Run it (from shell or using keybinding).
  2. Pick a password in dmenu.
  3. The password gets copied to your X clipboard for a limited amount of time.

The only difference is if you select `otpauth://` password, the script
automatically uses it to generate OTP, and copies that to your clipboard instead.


## Security Considerations

Disclaimer: This script runs the contents of your secret through `grep`. If you
don't trust your environment, it won't be safe to use!
